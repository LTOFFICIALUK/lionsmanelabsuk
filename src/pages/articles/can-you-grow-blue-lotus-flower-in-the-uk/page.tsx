          faqs={[
            {
              question: "Can blue lotus survive UK winters?",
              answer: "Blue lotus can survive UK winters with proper protection. For outdoor growing, the rhizomes need to be moved to heated indoor spaces or deep water (below frost line) during winter months. Greenhouse cultivation offers better winter survival rates."
            },
            {
              question: "How long does it take for blue lotus to flower in the UK?",
              answer: "Under optimal conditions, blue lotus plants typically begin flowering 3-4 months after planting. However, in the UK climate, flowering might take longer and may require supplemental heating to extend the growing season."
            },
            {
              question: "What's the best way to heat water for blue lotus?",
              answer: "Submersible aquatic heaters or pond heating systems can maintain appropriate water temperatures. Solar covers can help retain heat during cooler periods. For smaller setups, greenhouse or conservatory environments provide natural heat retention."
            },
            {
              question: "How often should I fertilize blue lotus?",
              answer: "During the growing season (spring and summer), fertilize every 2-4 weeks using aquatic plant tablets or liquid fertilizer. Reduce or stop fertilization during winter dormancy. Always use fertilizers specifically formulated for aquatic plants."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I grow blue lotus indoors in the UK?",
              answer: "Yes, blue lotus can be grown indoors in the UK using containers or indoor ponds. Ensure adequate lighting (natural or artificial), proper water temperature, and good ventilation. Indoor growing often provides more consistent conditions year-round."
            },
            {
              question: "What are common problems when growing blue lotus in the UK?",
              answer: "Common challenges include insufficient light levels, temperature fluctuations, algae growth, and winter protection. Most issues can be prevented with proper setup, regular maintenance, and seasonal care adjustments."
            },
            {
              question: "Do I need special permits to grow blue lotus in the UK?",
              answer: "No special permits are required to grow blue lotus for ornamental purposes in the UK. However, always check local regulations if planning large-scale cultivation or commercial use."
            },
            {
              question: "What's the best time to start growing blue lotus in the UK?",
              answer: "Early spring is ideal for starting blue lotus cultivation in the UK. This allows plants to establish during warmer months and develop strong growth before winter."
            },
            {
              question: "Can blue lotus be grown alongside other pond plants?",
              answer: "Yes, blue lotus can coexist with other aquatic plants. However, ensure adequate spacing and similar care requirements. Some good companions include water lilies and lotus varieties."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I propagate blue lotus in UK conditions?",
              answer: "Blue lotus can be propagated through rhizome division or from seeds. Division is more reliable in UK conditions and should be done during the active growing season."
