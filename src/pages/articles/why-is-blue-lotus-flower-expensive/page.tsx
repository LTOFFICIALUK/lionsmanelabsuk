          faqs={[
            {
              question: "Why has the price of Blue Lotus increased in recent years?",
              answer: "Global demand has grown rapidly due to increased interest in natural wellness products and traditional botanicals. Meanwhile, supply remains limited by growing conditions, harvest cycles, and production constraints. This imbalance between supply and demand has driven prices upward."
            },
            {
              question: "Is Blue Lotus worth the price?",
              answer: "For many users, yes. The quality, rarity, and effects make it a worthwhile addition to a wellness routine. The careful cultivation, harvesting, and processing required ensure consistent quality and potency. Consider your intended use and budget when making the decision."
            },
            {
              question: "Are cheaper versions of Blue Lotus safe?",
              answer: "Lower prices often indicate compromised quality, improper processing, or potential adulteration. Always buy from reputable sources that provide quality testing information and clear sourcing details. The risk of contamination or ineffective product makes extremely cheap options potentially unsafe."
            },
            {
              question: "Will prices come down in the future?",
              answer: "If cultivation expands or demand stabilizes, prices might decrease. However, the complex growing requirements and processing needs mean blue lotus will likely remain a premium product. Future price trends will depend on technological advances in cultivation and market dynamics."
            },
            {
              question: "How do different forms of blue lotus compare in price?",
              answer: "Prices vary by product form. Tea bags often cost more per gram due to processing and packaging, while loose dried flowers may offer better value for bulk purchases. Extracts and specialized preparations typically command premium prices due to concentrated potency."
            },
            {
              question: "What affects the quality-to-price ratio?",
              answer: "Key factors include growing conditions, harvest timing, processing methods, and quality control measures. Premium products often cost more but provide better potency and purity. Consider the intended use when evaluating value - some applications may require higher grade products."
            },
            {
              question: "How can I ensure I'm getting value for money?",
              answer: "Research suppliers thoroughly, check for quality certifications, and read customer reviews. Compare prices across reputable vendors, but be wary of unusually low prices. Consider bulk purchases if you're a regular user, but ensure proper storage capabilities."
            },
            {
              question: "Does organic certification affect the price?",
              answer: "Yes, organic certification adds significant costs through required testing, documentation, and ongoing compliance measures. However, it also ensures higher quality standards and sustainable practices. The price premium often reflects these additional quality assurance measures."
            },
            {
              question: "How do seasonal factors affect pricing?",
              answer: "Blue lotus prices can fluctuate seasonally due to growing cycles and harvest times. Peak harvest periods may offer better pricing, while off-season availability often commands premium prices. Some suppliers maintain consistent pricing through careful inventory management."
            },
            {
              question: "What role do transportation costs play?",
              answer: "Transportation significantly impacts price due to the need for temperature control, moisture protection, and careful handling. International shipping adds customs fees and compliance costs. Local sourcing when possible can help reduce these costs."
