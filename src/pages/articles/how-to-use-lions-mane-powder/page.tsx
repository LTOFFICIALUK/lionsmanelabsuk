            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Take with Food</h3>
            <p>
              Consuming Lion's Mane powder with food can enhance absorption and reduce potential digestive discomfort. The presence of fats and other nutrients helps the body process the beneficial compounds more effectively.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Heat Activation</h3>
            <p>
              Light heating can help activate some of the beneficial compounds in Lion's Mane powder. However, avoid excessive heat that might degrade the active ingredients:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Use warm (not boiling) water for tea preparation</li>
              <li>Add to warm foods rather than hot ones</li>
              <li>Avoid prolonged exposure to high temperatures</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Consistency is Key</h3>
            <p>
              Regular, consistent use is more important than perfect timing. Lion's Mane works best when taken daily over extended periods, allowing the beneficial compounds to build up in your system and support long-term cognitive health.
