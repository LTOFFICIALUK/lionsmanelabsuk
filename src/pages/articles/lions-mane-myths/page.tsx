            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Myth</h3>
            <p>
              Many people believe that Lion's Mane will provide immediate cognitive benefits within hours or days of taking it.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">The Reality</h3>
            <p>
              Lion's Mane works gradually and requires consistent use to achieve meaningful benefits:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Initial effects may be noticed after 2-4 weeks of consistent use</li>
              <li>Significant cognitive benefits typically develop over 2-3 months</li>
              <li>Full neuroprotective benefits may take 6-12 months to manifest</li>
              <li>Results vary significantly between individuals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Why This Myth Exists</h3>
            <p>
              This myth likely stems from the desire for quick fixes and the marketing of some supplement companies that promise rapid results. The reality is that Lion's Mane works by supporting long-term brain health and neuroplasticity, which are gradual processes.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Myth</h3>
            <p>
              Some sources claim that Lion's Mane can cure or completely reverse Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">The Reality</h3>
            <p>
              While Lion's Mane shows promise in supporting brain health, it cannot cure neurodegenerative diseases:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Research shows potential neuroprotective benefits</li>
              <li>May help slow cognitive decline in some cases</li>
              <li>Cannot reverse established brain damage</li>
              <li>Should be used as part of a comprehensive health approach</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">The Science</h3>
            <p>
              Studies suggest Lion's Mane may help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, but it cannot cure them. The research is promising but still in early stages, and more clinical trials are needed to fully understand its potential.

            question: "Are expensive Lion's Mane products always better?",
            answer: "Not necessarily. While price often reflects quality, it's more important to look for products with proper species identification, third-party testing, and reputable manufacturing. A moderately priced product from a trusted brand may be better than an expensive product without proper quality control."
