          faqs={[
            {
              question: "Is Blue Lotus similar to weed?",
              answer: "While both can promote relaxation, Blue Lotus does not contain THC and won't cause a high like cannabis. Its effects are gentler and more subtle, focusing on calm and clarity rather than intoxication."
            },
            {
              question: "Does Blue Lotus get you high?",
              answer: "Not in the way cannabis does. Blue Lotus may induce a mildly euphoric or dreamy state, but without the intense psychoactive effects associated with THC."
            },
            {
              question: "Is Blue Lotus legal where cannabis is not?",
              answer: "Often, yes. Blue Lotus is legal in most countries where cannabis is not, making it a more accessible option for those seeking natural relaxation support."
            },
            {
              question: "Can Blue Lotus replace weed for relaxation?",
              answer: "For some users, yes. Blue Lotus offers a natural, non-psychoactive way to unwind and is often used as an herbal alternative to cannabis, especially for those seeking milder effects."
            },
            {
              question: "How do the side effects compare?",
              answer: "Cannabis typically has more pronounced side effects including potential anxiety and cognitive impairment. Blue Lotus side effects are usually milder, mainly including mild drowsiness or relaxation."
            },
            {
              question: "Which is better for sleep?",
              answer: "Both can support sleep, but Blue Lotus is often preferred for its gentler effects and lower risk of morning grogginess. It's particularly good for natural sleep support."
            },
            {
              question: "Can you mix Blue Lotus and cannabis?",
              answer: "While some people do combine them, it's not recommended without careful consideration. The effects could be unpredictable, and it's better to use each separately."
            },
            {
              question: "How do costs compare?",
              answer: "Blue Lotus is generally more expensive per gram but requires smaller amounts for effects. Cannabis costs vary widely based on location and legality."

              question: "Are there drug testing concerns?",
