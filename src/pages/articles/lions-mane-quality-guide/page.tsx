        content={
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Species and Strain Identification</h3>
            <p>
              The first step in evaluating Lion's Mane quality is ensuring you're getting the correct species. Look for products that clearly specify:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Scientific name:</strong> Hericium Erinaceus (the most studied and effective species)</li>
              <li><strong>Strain information:</strong> Specific strain details when available</li>
              <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Where the mushroom was cultivated or harvested</li>
              <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Organic or other quality certifications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Cultivation Methods</h3>
            <p>
              High-quality Lion's Mane is typically grown using controlled cultivation methods:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Indoor cultivation:</strong> Controlled environment for consistent quality</li>
              <li><strong>Organic growing:</strong> No pesticides, herbicides, or synthetic fertilizers</li>
              <li><strong>Proper substrate:</strong> High-quality growing medium (hardwood sawdust, rice bran)</li>
              <li><strong>Harvest timing:</strong> Picked at optimal maturity for maximum potency</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Processing and Drying</h3>
            <p>
              The way Lion's Mane is processed after harvest significantly impacts quality:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Low-temperature drying:</strong> Preserves active compounds</li>
              <li><strong>Proper storage:</strong> Protected from light, heat, and moisture</li>
              <li><strong>Clean processing:</strong> No contamination or adulteration</li>
              <li><strong>Fresh processing:</strong> Processed soon after harvest</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Hot water extraction is the most common and effective method for Lion's Mane:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Extracts water-soluble compounds like beta-glucans</li>

            <p>
              Dual extraction provides the most comprehensive benefits:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Water extraction for water-soluble compounds</li>
              <li>Alcohol extraction for alcohol-soluble compounds</li>
              <li>Higher concentration of active compounds</li>
              <li>More expensive but more potent</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Extract Ratios and Concentrations</h3>
            <p>
              Look for products that specify:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Extract ratio:</strong> 8:1, 10:1, or higher ratios indicate concentration</li>
              <li><strong>Beta-glucan content:</strong> Should be 25% or higher</li>
              <li><strong>Polysaccharide content:</strong> Total polysaccharide percentage</li>
              <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Consistent levels of active compounds</li>
            </ul>

        faqs={[
          {
            question: "What's the difference between Lion's Mane extract and powder?",
            answer: "Lion's Mane extract is concentrated and standardized for consistent potency, while powder is the whole mushroom ground up. Extracts typically provide more reliable dosing and higher concentrations of active compounds, making them generally more effective."
          },
          {
            question: "How can I tell if a Lion's Mane supplement is high quality?",
            answer: "Look for products that specify the species (Hericium Erinaceus), provide third-party testing results, have clear extraction ratios, and come from reputable manufacturers. High-quality products should also have current COAs available."
          },
          {
            question: "What extraction ratio should I look for in Lion's Mane?",
            answer: "Look for extraction ratios of 8:1 or higher, which means 8 parts of raw mushroom were concentrated into 1 part of extract. Higher ratios generally indicate more concentrated and potent products."
          },
          {
            question: "Are organic Lion's Mane supplements better?",
            answer: "Organic certification ensures the mushrooms were grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. While not always necessary for quality, organic products often indicate higher standards and may be preferred for those concerned about chemical residues."
          },
          {
            question: "Should I choose capsules, powder, or tincture?",
            answer: "The best form depends on your preferences and needs. Capsules offer convenience and precise dosing, powder provides flexibility in usage, and tinctures offer fast absorption. All can be effective if they contain high-quality Lion's Mane extract."
          },
          {
            question: "How important is third-party testing for Lion's Mane?",
            answer: "Third-party testing is crucial for ensuring product quality, purity, and potency. It verifies that the product contains what it claims and is free from contaminants. Always choose products that provide current COAs from reputable testing laboratories."
