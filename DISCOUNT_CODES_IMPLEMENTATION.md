# Discount Code System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive discount code system has been implemented for Blue Dream Tea UK, featuring Supabase integration, admin management, and customer-facing functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`discount-codes-schema.sql`)

**Main Table: `discount_codes`**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `code` - Unique discount code (e.g., "WELCOME10")
- `description` - Human-readable description
- `discount_type` - "percentage" or "fixed"
- `discount_value` - Numeric value (percentage or fixed amount)
- `min_order_amount` - Minimum order value required
- `max_discount` - Maximum discount cap (optional)
- `max_uses` - Maximum number of times code can be used (optional)
- `current_uses` - Current usage count
- `start_date` - When code becomes active
- `end_date` - When code expires (optional, can be forever)
- `is_active` - Boolean flag for active/inactive status
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Timestamps

**Usage Tracking Table: `discount_code_usage`**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `discount_code_id` - Reference to discount code
- `order_id` - Reference to order
- `customer_email` - Customer who used the code
- `used_at` - When code was used
- `discount_amount` - Amount of discount applied
- `order_total` - Total order value

### 2. Backend Services (`src/utils/discount-service.ts`)

**Core Functions:**
- `getAllDiscountCodes()` - Fetch all discount codes
- `getActiveDiscountCodes()` - Fetch only active codes
- `validateDiscountCode(code, subtotal)` - Validate and get discount code
- `calculateDiscountAmount(discountCode, subtotal)` - Calculate discount amount
- `createDiscountCode(discountData)` - Create new discount code
- `updateDiscountCode(id, updates)` - Update existing discount code
- `deleteDiscountCode(id)` - Delete discount code
- `recordDiscountUsage(...)` - Record when code is used
- `getDiscountCodeStats(id)` - Get usage statistics
- `getAllDiscountCodeUsage()` - Get all usage records

**Validation Logic:**
- Checks if code exists and is active
- Validates start/end dates
- Ensures minimum order amount is met
- Checks usage limits
- Calculates appropriate discount amount

### 3. Cart Integration (`src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`)

**Updated Functions:**
- `applyDiscountCode(code)` - Now uses discount service for validation
- Removed mock discount codes in favor of database-driven system
- Real-time validation and calculation

**Features:**
- Automatic discount calculation
- Validation against minimum order amounts
- Support for both percentage and fixed discounts
- Usage tracking

### 4. Checkout Integration (`src/pages/checkout.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- Automatic discount code usage recording when order is placed
- Links discount usage to specific orders
- Tracks customer email and discount amount
- Updates usage count in database

### 5. Admin Management (`src/pages/admin.tsx`)

**New Section: "Discount Codes"**
- Complete CRUD operations for discount codes
- Visual table with all discount code information
- Create/Edit modal with comprehensive form
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Real-time status indicators

**Admin Features:**
- View all discount codes in organized table
- Create new discount codes with full configuration
- Edit existing discount codes
- Delete discount codes
- Monitor usage statistics
- Toggle active/inactive status
- Set start/end dates
- Configure usage limits

## Database Setup Instructions

1. **Run the Schema:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of discount-codes-schema.sql
   -- into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it
   ```

2. **Sample Data:**
   The schema includes sample discount codes:
   - `WELCOME10` - 10% off orders over £20
   - `SAVE5` - £5 off orders over £30
   - `FREESHIP` - Free shipping on any order
   - `SUMMER20` - 20% off everything
   - `NEWCUSTOMER` - 15% off first order

## Usage Flow

### For Customers:
1. Add items to cart
2. Enter discount code in cart page
3. System validates code and applies discount
4. Complete checkout
5. Discount usage is automatically recorded

### For Admins:
1. Access admin panel (`/admin`)
2. Navigate to "Discount Codes" section
3. Create, edit, or delete discount codes
4. Monitor usage statistics
5. Manage active/inactive status

## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Types (`src/types.d.ts`)
```typescript
export interface DiscountCode {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  description?: string;
  discount_type: 'percentage' | 'fixed';
  discount_value: number;
  min_order_amount: number;
  max_discount?: number;
  max_uses?: number;
  current_uses: number;
  start_date: string;
  end_date?: string;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface DiscountCodeUsage {
  id: string;
  discount_code_id: string;
  order_id: string;
  customer_email: string;
  used_at: string;
  discount_amount: number;
  order_total: number;
}
```

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required - uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Fallback System
- Works with localStorage when Supabase is not configured
- Provides mock data for development/testing
- Graceful degradation for demo purposes

## Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Input validation and sanitization
- Usage limits and expiration dates
- Unique constraint on discount codes
- Audit trail through usage tracking

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient validation queries
- Caching of active discount codes
- Optimized usage tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Customer-Specific Codes:**
   - Generate unique codes for specific customers
   - First-time customer discounts
   - Loyalty program integration

2. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Discount code performance metrics
   - Revenue impact analysis
   - Customer behavior tracking

3. **Automated Campaigns:**
   - Scheduled discount code activation
   - Email marketing integration
   - Seasonal promotions

4. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Import/export discount codes
   - Bulk status updates
   - Mass code generation

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms:
- Database connection failures
- Invalid discount codes
- Expired codes
- Usage limit exceeded
- Minimum order not met

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check Supabase connection and permissions
2. Verify discount code configuration
3. Review usage tracking logs
4. Test with sample discount codes provided
