# Blue Lotus Article Migration Tools

This directory contains tools and templates to efficiently migrate your 100+ Shopify articles to your custom Blue Dream Tea UK website while maintaining SEO value and improving content quality.

```

### 2. Run the Migration Script
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install yargs

# Preview the migration (recommended first)
node batch-migration-script.js --input my-articles.json --dry-run --verbose
